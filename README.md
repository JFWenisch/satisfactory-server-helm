# Satisfactory Dedicated Server Helm Chart

This chart deploys a dedicated Satisfactory server in your k8s stack.

You need to have a LoadBalancer installed and all three defined ports unused, 
in order for this chart to work.

See https://github.com/andre161292/satisfactory-server for more information 
about the values used.
